This project focuses on analyzing ice cream sales data using PySpark for data preprocessing and building model using star schema and  Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization. The primary goal was to transform raw transactional data into a structured star schema using dimension and fact tables, enabling deeper insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (PySpark)

Star Schema 

Excel (for saving processed data)

Power BI (for visualization)

📊 Key Features:

Created clean and optimized dimension tables (e.g., Product, Customer, Date).

Built a fact table capturing core sales metrics like quantity, price, and discount.

Exported the transformed data to Excel files.

Designed a Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Top-selling ice cream flavors

Seasonal sales trends

Customer segmentation

Region-wise performance

📈 Outcome:
This project demonstrates efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) handling with PySpark and professional dashboard creation for business insights.
